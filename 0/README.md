This is the starting point for the 2019 Warrior Way Coding Camp at Brookwood School.

Students will start with these files, and will build out the app until it has the functionality of the project in the "final" folder.

Each step along the way has its own folder. This folder contains the project files, as they should be at the **completion** of the step: app.js, index.html, and style.css. It also contains the images needed for that step in the images sub-folder. Finally, there is a basic lesson plan for that step in the README file.

Instructor should:
* Provide the starter files in this folder (but **not** this README) to students, as a starting point for the project.
* Use the README in each step as a guide to helping students complete that step.
* Use the project files in the step folders as reference for the output that the students should be producing in each step.

Students should:
* Work on their own machines, maintaining their own project files in one folder.
* (Optional) Use Git for version control, committing at the end of each step
